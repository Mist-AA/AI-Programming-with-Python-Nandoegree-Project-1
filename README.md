# Using a Pre-Trained Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds
The project makes use of a pre-trained image classifier and then identifies the pet images to classify the different dog breeds. 
The performance of various CNN model architectures is compared and the time resources for an optimal solution are considered.
### Architectures compared
* ResNet
* AlexNet
* VGG

### Source
This is the first project in the AI programming with python nanodegree course on Udacity. The objective is to - Use a Pre-trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds
